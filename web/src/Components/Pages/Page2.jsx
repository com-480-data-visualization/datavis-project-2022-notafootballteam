        The below map provides with a larger overview of happiness rate in the world.
        As many economical statistics, the correlation with the economical production per capita (≈ personal richness) is obvious:
         just change the slider to “GDP/capita” to convince yourself of the similarities.

        Previous research has shown Social Support, Life expectancy, Freedom, Absence of corruption and Generosity as good candidates.
        A simple click on a country will select it and update the whole website accordingly.
        The radar chart in the corner provides deeper insight of these parameters, and relative comparison.

         (the project aims to make the visitors and its authors happy). 
         The American association of psyhology has published various studies showing alcohol acts as a social lubricant:
          alcohol was supposed to minimize negative emotions. If our first ambition was to show such an effect at country level, 
          those attempts did not pay. However, we aim to continue providing complete information to the reader 
          considering his or her future place to live and we could not exclude alcohol. 
          The above histograms act as a comparison between the happiness tier in the considered country 
          and the alcohol consumption “performances” of its inhabitants. We consider this as a somehow acceptable metric 
          of the “lifestyle” you are expected to have - party hard western, true slavic gopnik or sober hardworker, 
          the choice is now yours! Many thanks for your attention and we do hope this work will contribute 
          into making you find the country who really makes you happy!`}
