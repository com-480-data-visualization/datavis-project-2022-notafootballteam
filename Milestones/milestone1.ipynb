    "#### About\n",
    "The dataset contains yearly happiness scores by country (= item) in the period 2006 through 2021.\n",
    "To get the scores respondents are asked to rate their own lives on a 0 to 10 scale, i.e. it uses the [Cantril Scale](https://news.gallup.com/poll/122453/understanding-gallup-uses-cantril-scale.aspx).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "The survey is conduceted on a regular semi-annual to biennial frequency depending on the country.\n",
    "The sample size for each country is on average 1,000 people, but can be 2000 for bigger countries like China or Russia. Samples are weighted to correct for selection bias, nonresponse and other issues.\n",
    "[[1](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx)]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countries that do not have a happiness score for some years. In that case we decided to do an interpolation such that all countries have a happiness score value for all years going from 2006 to 2021. In addition the 2022 data is used from the Kaggle webpage [World Happiness Report up to 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2022.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "Other than the happiness score, the dataset also contains the following attributes:\n",
    "- regional indicator of the country,\n",
    "- standard error of the score,\n",
    "- lower and upper whiskers,\n",
    "- 6 indicators (columns) that may contribute to a happier life:\n",
    "        - Econimic production \n",
    "        - Social support\n",
    "        - Life expectency\n",
    "        - Freedom\n",
    "        - Absence of corruption\n",
    "        - Generosity\n",
    "- \"Ladder score in Dystopia\",\n",
    "- \"Dystopia + residual\",\n",
    "- attributes named \"Explained by:\" corresponding to each of the 6 indicators (in statistics terms, this is likely the R<sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination for the variable)."

    "#### About\n",
    "The dataset contains yearly alcohol consumption per capita for each country of the world and also regions of the world (ex: Africa Eastern and Southern, Arab World) and some aggregates (Low income, Upper middle income, Least developed countries: UN classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of consumed alcohol corresponds to the liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita for people that are 15 years of age or older over a calendar year, it is adjusted for tourist consumption. \n",

    "#### Quality\n",
    "The data covers years going from 2000 to 2018 (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018), so for the majority of countries there are 5 entries, for the countries that do not have the 5 entries (Like for example Afghanistan) we would like for our other dataset perform an interpolation to complete the missing values."

    "Money does not make you happy… or does it? The most popular view of the relation between happiness* and life quality presents it as [logarithmic](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/14/money-can-buy-happiness-but-only-to-a-point.html). But what if we look at a country level? Happiness certainly is correlated with GDP/inhabitant but some very surprising cases lie out of bonds. What are those countries, and what other factors play a role? Is there any interesting correlation that could “explain” happy but not so rich countries, or sad rich states?\n",
    "\n",
    "We would indeed expect a positive tight between a country's happiness (\"life ladder\"), social support, health, freedom of choice and generosity. The other way around, corruption perception is expected to decrease happiness. Further analysis of this topic will be addressed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second part, we will investigate a less serious (at least it should make **us** happy) relation. The American association of psyhology has published various studies showing alcohol works as a social [lubricant](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/alcohol-is-a-social-lubricant-study-confirms.html). Alcohol is supposed to minimize negative emotions. We will therefore try to show such relations at country level : do some countries tend to be happier than others, all other parameters equal, just because they drink alcohol? Or at least, is social support higher due to alcohol consumtion? If we would of course not show any direct implication, this could be of nice interest for future reasearch. \n",

The project’s webpage will also briefly describe interesting outlier cases while mentioning cultural differences and connecting to world events.\n",

    "Finally, another intended purpose of the project is entertainement. Although it is possible that a correlation may exist between happiness and alcohol consumption, our motivation is not to demonstrate a causal relation. Therefore, we will NOT attempt to show that alcohol is capable of boosting happiness levels in the long term."

    "For the sake of practicality and to allow for more scalability, several medium complexity level visualizations are proposed, as opposed to a large complex visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having a central <b>timeline slider</b> on the webpage, the user can query entries from 2006 to 2022. As discussed, missing values are interpolated. With a certain selected year, the following are the planned visualizations:\n",
    "- <b>Distribution Plot for Happiness /  Alcohol Consumption.</b>\n",
    "The objective is to plot the skew of the Happiness Score and alcohol consumption distributions to highlight their uniformity or equality and discuss it. When hovering over each “bin” (i.e. vertical bar), the countries in that bin would become visible with the respective values.\n",
    "- <b>Change of Ranking over Time (Bar Chart).</b>\n",
    "Using a horizontal bar chart, the objective is to visualize the evolution of the ranking of the happiest countries.\n",
    "- <b>Correlation: Scatterplot.</b>\n",
    "The objective is to create an interactive 2D scatterplot, where the user can select the X-axis attribute (default: alcohol consumtion), while the Y-axis attribute is fixed to Happiness Score. Each point in the scatterplot would represent a country. The points can be color-coded based on the georegion, or the actual flag of the country. When a country is selected, the user would see the country’s connected scatterplot positions from 2006 to 2022.\n",
    "- <b>Magnitude: [Radar Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart).</b>\n",
    "The objective is to create an interactive radar chart with the Happiness Score attribute at the top corner while others are the remaining corners.\n",

    "- <i>Optional: Fun animation.</i>\n",
    "An animation which demonstrates the magnitude of the alcohol consumed per capita by country. For example, a bottle that gets filled by country-themed bubbles; their number corresponds to the respective value for that country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Scatterplot, the Radar Chart and the Map are connected: hovering/tapping on a country on the scatterplot would also update the radar chart line and would highlight the country on the map, and vice versa."
