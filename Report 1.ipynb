    "#### About\n",
    "The dataset contains yearly happiness scores by country (= item) in the period 2006 through 2021.\n",
    "To get the scores respondents are asked to rate their own lives on a 0 to 10 scale, i.e. it uses the [Cantril Scale](https://news.gallup.com/poll/122453/understanding-gallup-uses-cantril-scale.aspx).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality\n",
    "The survey is conduceted on a regular semi-annual to biennial frequency depending on the country.\n",
    "The sample size for each country is on average 1,000 people, but can be 2000 for bigger countries like China or Russia. Samples are weighted to correct for selection bias, nonresponse and other issues.\n",
    "[[1](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx)]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countries that do not have a happiness score for some years. In that case we decided to do an interpolation such that all countries have a happiness score value for all years going from 2006 to 2021. In addition the 2022 data is used from the Kaggle webpage [World Happiness Report up to 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2022.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "Other than the happiness score, the dataset also contains the following attributes:\n",
    "- regional indicator of the country,\n",
    "- standard error of the score,\n",
    "- lower and upper whiskers,\n",
    "- 6 indicators (columns) that may contribute to a happier life:\n",
    "        - Econimic production \n",
    "        - Social support\n",
    "        - Life expectency\n",
    "        - Freedom\n",
    "        - Absence of corruption\n",
    "        - Generosity\n",
    "- \"Ladder score in Dystopia\",\n",
    "- \"Dystopia + residual\",\n",
    "- attributes named \"Explained by:\" corresponding to each of the 6 indicators (in statistics terms, this is likely the R<sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination for the variable)."

    "#### About\n",
    "The dataset contains yearly alcohol consumption per capita for each country of the world and also regions of the world (ex: Africa Eastern and Southern, Arab World) and some aggregates (Low income, Upper middle income, Least developed countries: UN classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of consumed alcohol corresponds to the liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita for people that are 15 years of age or older over a calendar year, it is adjusted for tourist consumption. \n",

    "#### Quality\n",
    "The data covers years going from 2000 to 2018 (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018), so for the majority of countries there are 5 entries, for the countries that do not have the 5 entries (Like for example Afghanistan) we would like for our other dataset perform an interpolation to complete the missing values."

    "Money does not make you happy… or does it? The most popular view of the relation between happiness* and life quality presents it as [logarithmic](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/14/money-can-buy-happiness-but-only-to-a-point.html). But what if we look at a country level? Happiness certainly is correlated with GDP/inhabitant but some very surprising cases lie out of bonds. What are those countries, and what other factors play a role? Is there any interesting correlation that could “explain” happy but not so rich countries, or sad rich states?\n",

The other way around, corruption perception is expected to decrease happiness. Further analysis of this topic will be addressed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second part, we will investigate a less serious (at least it should make **us** happy) relation. The American association of psyhology has published various studies showing alcohol works as a social [lubricant](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/alcohol-is-a-social-lubricant-study-confirms.html). Alcohol is supposed to minimize negative emotions. We will therefore try to show such relations at country level : do some countries tend to be happier than others, all other parameters equal, just because they drink alcohol? Or at least, is social support higher due to alcohol consumtion? If we would of course not show any direct implication, this could be of nice interest for future reasearch. \n",
